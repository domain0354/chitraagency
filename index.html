Here's a simple example of a website with a link to Google using HTML:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Google Link Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>Click the link below to visit Google:</p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google</a>
</body>
</html>


This code creates a basic webpage with a heading, paragraph, and link to Google. When you click the link, it will take you to the Google homepage.

To use this code:

1. Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) and copy the code into it.
2. Save the file.
3. Open the file in a web browser to view the webpage.
